# pybuster
it's basically gobuster but written in python...

if you don't know what gobuster is it's used to find paths in domains :

https://website.com/m͟a͟i͟n͟
the underlined part is the path 
(i supplied a wordlist with the most used/common paths...)

may add proxy support in the future... :)

it's useful for hacking websites because you can find admin pages etc.


*that being said it's for educational purposes only.
